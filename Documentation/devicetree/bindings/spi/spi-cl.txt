* SPI driver for Critical Link SOC FPGA SPI Controller

Required properties:
- compatible : Should be "cl,spi-1.0".
- reg : Contains one entry, which is a tuple consisting of a
	physical address and length.  The entry is the address and
	length of the controller register set.
- interrupts : Unit interrupt specifier for the controller interrupt.
- master-ref-clk : Specifies the frequency of the controller input clock.
- num-chipselect : Number of chip select lines.
- bus-num : Number of the SPI bus to which the controller is connected.

Example:

	clspi: spi@ff210000 {
		compatible = "cl,spi-1.0";
		#address-cells = <1>;
		#size-cells = <0>;
		reg = <0xff210000 0x0100>,
		interrupts = <0 40 4>;
		master-ref-clk = <750000000>;
		num-chipselect = <8>;
		bus-num = <3>;
	}
